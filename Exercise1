Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
tuple() method can convert list to tuple

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Question: Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Let's create an empty list

# Let's add some values
my_list.____("Python")

# Let's verify that it's correct
assert my_list == ["Python", "is neat"]
2. Create a new list without modifiying the original one
original = ["I", "am", "learning", "hacking", "in"]
# Your implementation here
modified = 
assert original == ["I", "am", "learning", "hacking", "in"]
assert modified ==
list1 = [6, 12, 5]
list2 = [6.2, 0, 14, 1]
list3 = [0.9]

# Your implementation here
my_list = 
print(my_list)
